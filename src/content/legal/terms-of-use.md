# Terms of Use

Welcome to **foggymtndrifter.com**. By hanging out here, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, you can simply close the tab (but I'll be sad to see you go).

## 1. The Gist

This is a personal blog. I write code, I write opinions, and sometimes I write bugs. Use the site as intended, don't try to hack it, and we'll get along fine.

## 2. Comments (Be Nice)

Comments are hosted via **giscus** (GitHub Discussions).
-   **Don't be a jerk.** No hate speech, harassment, or spam.
-   **I have the ban hammer.** I reserve the right to hide or delete comments that violate common decency (or just really annoy me).
-   **Your words are yours.** You own your comments, but by posting them here, you let me display them.

## 3. Money Stuff (Donations)

If you use the donation modal:
-   **Thank you!** You are awesome.
-   **No Refunds.** Please treat donations like dropping a tip in a jar. Once it's in, it's coffee money. I can't easily process refunds, so please double-check the amount.
-   **Security.** Payments are processed by Stripe. I don't touch your financial data.

## 4. Code & Content

-   **My Stuff:** The text and images are mine unless noted otherwise. Please don't scrape the whole site and repost it as your own.
-   **Code Snippets:** Feel free to use code snippets from my blog posts in your own projects. That's why they are there. A link back is appreciated but not required.
-   **No Warranty:** If you copy-paste code from here and it crashes your production server, that is unfortunate, but it is not my fault. **Always** review code before running it.

## 5. Third Parties

I link to other sites (like GitHub, Stripe, or random cool blogs). I'm not responsible for what happens on those sites.

## 6. Liability (The "Don't Sue Me" Clause)

This site is provided "as is." I try my best to keep it running and accurate, but I make no promises. I am not liable for any damages (digital, emotional, or otherwise) resulting from your use of this site.

## 7. Changes

I can change these terms whenever. If you keep using the site, you accept the new terms.
