# Privacy Policy

Look, I'm a normie, not a data broker. I built this site to share stuff, not to harvest your personal details. But, for the sake of transparency (and because the internet requires it), here is exactly what is happening with your data.

## 1. The "Who Are You?" Part (Analytics)

I use **Umami** for analytics. Ideally, I'd like to know if anyone is actually reading my blog posts or if I'm just shouting into the void.
-   **No Cookies:** Umami doesn't use cookies to track you.
-   **No Personal Data:** It doesn't collect your IP address or fingerprint your device.
-   **Just Numbers:** It just tells me "Hey, someone visited from the internet." That's it.

## 2. The "Yelling at Me" Part (Comments)

I use GitHub Discussions to power my comments section. When you post a comment, you are interacting directly with the GitHub API. Please refer to GitHub's Privacy Policy for more information on how they handle your data. This means I don't store your comments in a database; GitHub does.

-   If you want to know what GitHub does with your data, you'll have to read [their privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement). I assume it involves storing your comment.

## 3. The "Free Coffee" Part (Donations)

If you are generous enough to buy me a coffee via the "sudo buy-coffee" modal:
-   **Stripe** handles all the heavy lifting.
-   I **never** see your credit card number. It goes straight to Stripe's secure vault.
-   Stripe might collect your email or name to send you a receipt, but that's between you and them.
-   You can read Stripe's privacy policy [here](https://stripe.com/privacy) if you enjoy reading legal documents.

## 4. Cookies (The Digital Kind)

I prefer the oatmeal raisin variety. This site itself is pretty much cookie-free.
-   **However:** Third-party services like **Stripe** (for payments) and **GitHub** (for comments) might verify you are human (or logged in) using cookies.
-   I have no control over those, but they are generally essential for security and functionality.

## 5. Your Rights

You have the right to remain silent... wait, wrong script.
You have the right to access, correct, or delete your data. Since I generally don't *have* your data (it's with Stripe or GitHub), you'll likely need to contact them directly. But if you think I have something of yours, feel free to reach out.

## 6. Changes

I might update this page if I add new features. I'll change the date below if I do.

## 7. Contact

If you have questions, [email me](mailto:michael@foggymtndrifter.com) or send a carrier pigeon.
