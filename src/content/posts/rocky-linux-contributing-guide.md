I've always been passionate about open source software. The idea of collaborative communities building powerful tools freely available to everyone resonated deeply with me. Yet, for a long time, I was just a user, a beneficiary. I'd never taken the plunge into actually *contributing* to an open source project.

That all changed when the CentOS landscape shifted. Like many, I was caught off guard by the news around CentOS 8. Reading Greg Kurtzer's announcement of Rocky Linux on the CentOS blog, something clicked. This was my chance to put my belief in open source into action.

With a mix of excitement and apprehension, I joined the Rocky Linux Slack (which later transitioned to Mattermost). I had zero open source contribution experience, yet I found a welcoming community eager to bring enthusiastic people on board. I started by talking to the then Web Team Lead, and soon I was making small contributions to the Rocky Linux website.

My involvement grew quickly. As my contributions increased, so did my sense of ownership in the project. Before I knew it, I was leading the Web Team, overseeing the development and maintenance of the main Rocky Linux site. It was incredibly rewarding!

I've since scaled back my involvement in that specific role, but remain integral in shaping the project's visual identity as the Design Team Lead. The thrill of helping a crucial open source project remains the same.

## How You Can Make a Difference

My story isn't about being a technical genius. It's about the power of the Rocky Linux community, a community that throws its doors wide open and says, "Come build with us!" If you're intrigued by this project, here's your roadmap for getting involved:

1. **Join the Mattermost Chat:** The heart of the Rocky Linux community beats on [Mattermost](https://chat.rockylinux.org). Dive right in!
2. **Explore Your Interests:** Find channels that align with your skills or areas you want to learn about. Maybe you like to write; documentation is always needed. Love to design? Join me on the Design Team. If you're a developer, well, the possibilities are endless.
3. **Let Your Voice Be Heard:** Don't be shy! Introduce yourself within the channels, let people know you're interested in helping out. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll be guided towards ways to contribute.

## Open Doors, Open Community

The core of Rocky Linux is its inclusivity. Whether you're a seasoned expert, a student wanting to learn, or someone who just wants to give back to the open source world, there's a place for you.

Don't think you have to become a team lead like I did to make a difference. Every pull request reviewed, every documentation page written, every design asset created; it all matters. We're not just building an operating system; we're building a vibrant community.
