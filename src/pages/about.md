I've been drawn to technology and problem-solving for as long as I can remember.

My passion for open source has been a driving force throughout my career. I currently serve as the Design Team Lead for Rocky Linux, where I collaborate with a community of talented developers dedicated to creating a robust, community-driven enterprise Linux distribution.

When I'm not immersed in code or troubleshooting systems, you'll find me exploring the natural beauty around Pikeville, Kentucky. I cherish time spent hiking through the mountains and observing wildlife in their natural habitats.

I'm also constantly tinkering with new projects; building and programming solutions to automate tasks and make life more efficient. There's something deeply satisfying about creating tools that solve real problems, whether it's for work or just to simplify day-to-day activities at home.
